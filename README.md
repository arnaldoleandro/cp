# cp
reboot of cp project after lost all code


### Six years later

I finally feel like I can continue this side project haha
I just added a chatgpt definition for the original game.


### Thoughts

-20230403: After these 6 years I learned a lot of new things, many techs arrived. I started this idea using Java and now I don't even know how to print "Hello World!" using Java! hahahha
